An attempt to translate Mitsubishi WF RAC to Java (ideally to use within openhab), however initial attempts are just to make a useable aircon object. 



Code in progress not working or debugged.

Todo: Error checking in AirCon Methods for if elements are null. 
To remove set methods for variables that cannot be edited ie sensor data.
