This I think is the cause of the units sometimes turning off. 
the remote control for example stops at 18 when in cold mode.

add feature to live remove units to the bridge via mqtt message. 


MqttAirConBridge:  to consolidate the handleTOpics functions. I think i can override the function to name the functions
