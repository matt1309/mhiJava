Expose more MQTT options: Like TLS MQTT and more options rather than just username and password support

Add safety features for values which aren't allowed ie operationMode 0-4 etc.
This I think is the cause of the units sometimes turning off. 
the remote control for example stops at 18 when in cold mode. 

Users could setup the limits in openhab but in here feels safe enough.
