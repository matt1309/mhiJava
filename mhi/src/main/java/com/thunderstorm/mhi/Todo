Expose more MQTT options: Like TLS MQTT and more options rather than just username and password support
Add safety features for values which aren't allowed ie operationMode 0-4 etc.

Rate limiting/overloading MQTT solution. 
I think sending data using a queue or even just in a seperate thread is better.
