Implement safety features for statically allowed entries. 
Implement the use of settings files so can run as a service. ie json object for each unit, settings read by this program running as a service. 


Need to add support for multiple aircon units with one service. (almost done)

Pass in a list of aircon units into constructor and change the layout of handleTopics functions so that aircon ID's are used.
